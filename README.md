🚘 Mercedes-Benz Sales Performance Dashboard
Strategic Product & Market Intelligence Analysis (2020–2025)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study analyzing Mercedes-Benz sales performance from 2020 to 2025.

The objective was to transform raw sales data into strategic product and market intelligence insights using:

- Python (EDA & ETL)
- SQL Server (Advanced Business Queries)
- Power BI (Multi-Page Executive Dashboard)
- 
The final result is a structured, consulting-style dashboard focused on product performance, pricing strategy, EV transition, and growth stability.

🎯 Business Objectives

This project answers the following strategic questions:

1. Which models are driving overall sales performance?
2. Are premium and ultra-luxury models aligned with demand?
3. Does horsepower and turbo configuration influence sales?
4. Is the company becoming more dependent on high-end segments?
5. How fast is EV adoption accelerating?
6. Which models show stable vs volatile demand?
7. Is overall sales growth consistent year-over-year?
